Gone is the soft carpet of that nightmarish mension. Instead you feel blood running down your face while you realize that you can finally use your eyes normally again and start to realize where you are.

\"My son! Your time on earth has ended as your presence has corrupted the spiritual world to a point from which it can never recover. Soon, darkness will rise and we'll get back the place that belongs to us! You did well.\"
